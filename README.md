# Camera2API
This repository provides code for using the camera2 API. Both the front and rear cameras are used in this demo. Image rotation is corrected using exif interface data. The code makes provision for saving the images locally.

As an extra, the shape of the TextureView used for the front facing camera is changed into a circle using an overlay.
